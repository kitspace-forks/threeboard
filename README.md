threeboard is a fully functional multi-layer, programmable mechanical keyboard with only three keys!

Unlike a traditional keyboard, keypresses aren't sent directly to the computer on each keypress. Instead, combinations of the three keys are used to specify key and modifier codes to send to the computer. The multiple layers allow programming key, word, and text blobs for later retrieval.

The project (including the hardware) is open source, and is extensively documented to help those with no embedded programming experience understand how the hardware and firmware are built!

## Building threeboard
Although the threeboard requires custom hardware to run, it also comes with a fully functional terminal-based simulator which runs the firmware on macOS and Linux.
